## Key Capabilities
### 1. Vendor Visibility & Performance Insights

- Daily and near real-time metrics per vendor:

  - Successful transactions

  - Failed transactions
  
  - Total API calls

Performance breakdown by:
  - Transaction type (Airtime / Data)

- Telco

- Trend monitoring to spot degradation before full outages occur

### 2. Automated Failover (Reliability by Design)

- Vendors are continuously evaluated against health thresholds.

- When a vendor breaches failure limits:

  - Traffic is automatically rerouted to healthy vendors

  - The failing vendor is temporarily excluded

- No human intervention required during incidents.

### 3. Controlled Manual Intervention

- Authorized users can enable or disable vendors via the portal.

- Eliminates direct database manipulation.

- Supports edge cases where human judgment is required.

### 4. SLA Tracking & Vendor Accountability

- Tracks vendor uptime, failure rates, and response performance.

- Aligns operational metrics with contractual SLAs.

- Generates objective performance data over time.

 ### 5. Vendor Escalation Integration
- Real-time escalation when failure thresholds are breached.

- Reduces Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR).

- Keeps internal teams and vendors aligned during incidents.
