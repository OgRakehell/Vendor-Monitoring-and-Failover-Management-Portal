## Problem Context

- The platform integrates with multiple third-party airtime and data vendors. In the existing state:

- Vendor failures are detected late, often after customer complaints.

- Disabling a failing vendor requires manual SQL scripts, executed by technical staff.

- There is no single source of truth for vendor performance.

- As transaction volume and vendor count grow, the model becomes unsustainable.

From a product perspective, this creates:

- Poor customer experience during vendor outages

- High operational overhead

- Increased risk of human error

- Limited ability to evaluate vendor performance objectively
