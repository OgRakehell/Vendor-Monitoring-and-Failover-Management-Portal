## Product Goals

- Improve transaction success rates without increasing operational effort

- Detect vendor issues early and respond automatically

- Give stakeholders real-time visibility into vendor performance

- Enable safe scaling to multiple vendors

## Solution Overview
The Vendor Management Portal acts as a control plane for all airtime and data vendors.

It introduces:

- Automated failover logic

- Role-based manual overrides

- SLA tracking and vendor performance reporting

- A vendor-agnostic architecture for future expansion

This allows the business to move from reactive firefighting to proactive reliability management.
